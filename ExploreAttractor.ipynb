Using higher-order integration methods improves the results, giving us a more accurate estimation.  The euler method will give us the least accurate estimation, followed by the 2nd order Runge-Kutta, and so on.  In this particular project, the 4th order Runge-Kutta will give us the most accurate prediction."

Say, for instance, the initial conditions are close to the real value, then the amount of time to reach the real value will be small.  Contrary to this, if the initial conditions put us at a value farther than the real value, then the amount of time to reach that real value will be greater.   Due to my project not working correctly, I am not sure how small of a change will reproduce roughly the same curve."
